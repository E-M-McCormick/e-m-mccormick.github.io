If you are interested in working together – or know of interested students – please get in touch at emccorm @ udel [dot] edu.\n\n\nI am an Assistant Professor of Educational Statistics and Data Science in the School of Education at the University of Delaware. I am also affiliated with the Data Science Institute as a Resident Faculty, the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences and with the Methodology & Statistics unit at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\nMy research interests focus on a number of methodological approaches for longitudinal, time series, and psychometric modeling in the fields of education and development. My current work includes developing methods for: distal outcome and time-varying covariate growth models, improving estimation of nonlinear and moderated parameter models for testing specific research hypotheses, and using Bayesian approaches for merging longitudinal and time series models.\nFor the full details of my academic bio, please see my CV."

However, in many phenomenon, we might expect more complex group and individual directional changes. To capture these nonlinear trends, in this paper we laid out a formulation of a DSEM with semi-parametric splines to capture nonlinear changes in the outcome over the assessment period.\nØystein Sørensen, Ethan M.
