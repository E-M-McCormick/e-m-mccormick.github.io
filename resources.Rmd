### [Longitudinal Primer Codebook Companion <i class="fas fa-book"></i>](static/longitudinal-primer/index.html)

A primarily R-based companion to the preprint [McCormick, Byrne, Flournoy, Mills, & Pfiefer, (*preprint*)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ga4qz). Here we provide the syntax to accomplish the models we discussed in the main text. Sprinkled in are tips and tricks for the best way to fit various model options, with some additional resources in other programs when needed.
